Title: twitch for studying

Description: While working from home, our team agree that sometime we get lazy and our productivity is not as expected. We realized that this is due to a lack of supervision. For example, you have a tend not to watch youtube while working in the office because you are afraid to be judged by your coworkers. Moreover, by just watching our colleagues working, people have a strong motivation to work. Therefore, it is neccessary to create an environment where people feel that they are being supervised, then the productivity will be pushed. 
Our team's product aim to create an online environment like that. Particularly, we build a website where people can log in to live stream themselves working or just watching another user livestream while doing their work. Livestreamers will get the reactions/comments from their viewers after finishing their work and review their work for that day.
